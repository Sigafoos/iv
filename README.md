# Pokemon Go IV Service
An API to query for how a Pokemon's IVs rank for PVP in Pokemon Go.

## Using
```
HOST=localhost \
PORT=8080 \
POKEMON=lucario \
IVs=15/15/15 \
curl -H'accept: application/json' "$HOST:$PORT/iv?pokemon=$POKEMON&ivs=$IVs"
```

## Building
```
$ go build
$ ./iv
```

A `data/` firectory must be present with data generated by the `ivservice/generate` binary, one json file per Pokemon.

### Generating data
In the `generate` directory there must be a `gamemaster.json` file. Rather than parse the json from the Game Master file myself I use the one in the [PvPoke repo](https://github.com/pvpoke/pvpoke/blob/master/src/data/gamemaster.json). If that is ever not present, this is the format it expects:

```json
{
    "pokemon": [
        {
          "dex": 1,
          "speciesName": "Bulbasaur",
          "speciesId": "bulbasaur",
          "baseStats": {
            "atk": 118,
            "def": 111,
            "hp": 128
        },
	...
}
```

Run `generate` to create the `data/` directory.
